** Sample response file for IBM DB2
** --------------------------------
** To select features and settings to install, uncomment the corresponding
** keywords and specify values for those keywords.  You do not need to select
** features if you select the TYPICAL or COMPACT installation options.
**
** Comments are made by placing either an asterisk (*) or a hash symbol (#) at
** the start of a line, or by placing ** or ## after the start of a line to
** comment out the rest of that line.
** All keywords that are currently uncommented (not preceded by * or #) are
** mandatory and must be assigned values for the installation to continue.
** All other keywords are optional. If optional keywords are not specified,
** the installation will proceed using default values. Lines that start out
** with two asterisks are documentation and should not be enabled.

** General Options
** ---------------

** Only one product can be specified for the following PROD keyword. Specifying
** multiple products in an installation is not supported.
PROD                      = <%= @product %>

** The FILE keyword determines the base installation path. If you specify a
** path that does not yet have this product, this will install a new copy.  If
** you specify a path that has this product, this will be considered an
** existing installation intended to install additional functionality.  This is
** a mandatory keyword for root installation. Remove this keyword for non-root
** installation. If not removed, its value must be $HOME/sqllib where $HOME
** represents the HOME directory of the non-root user ID that owns the non-root
** installation.
FILE                      = <%= @p_install_dest %>

** Modify the value of the following LIC_AGREEMENT keyword to indicate that you
** have read and agreed to the license agreement file in the db2/license
** directory on the CD.
LIC_AGREEMENT             = ACCEPT         ** ACCEPT or DECLINE

** If an interactive type is set, db2setup will prompt for CD locations and
** give feedback as to progress, otherwise nothing will be displayed until the
** installation is complete.
*INTERACTIVE              = NONE            ** NONE, YES, MACHINE
INTERACTIVE               = MACHINE         ** NONE, YES, MACHINE

** The PACKAGE_LOCATION keyword is used only when the NLPACK is not available
** and any national languages are to be installed. This keyword specifies the
** location of the NLPACK.
*PACKAGE_LOCATION         =                 ** Any valid path

** The CONFIG_ONLY keyword is used to specify that the response file is being
** used for creating or configuring an instance, and nothing is to be
** installed. This keyword must be set to YES if a response file is used with
** db2isetup.
*CONFIG_ONLY              =                 ** YES or NO

** INSTALL_TYPE keyword is used to select the installation type. If you specify
** a TYPICAL or a COMPACT install type, no COMP keywords are required. In this
** case the installer will select the appropriate components for you.  All COMP
** keywords are ignored by the installer unless the INSTALL_TYPE is set  to
** CUSTOM. If you select the CUSTOM install type, then ensure that you enable 
** all of the COMP keywords that are required for your database environment.
** 
** Note: The install type is not related to the language selection.
** ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALL_TYPE              = CUSTOM         ** TYPICAL, COMPACT, CUSTOM

** The following components are part of all TYPICAL installations. If you
** perform a typical installation, all of these components will be installed on
** your computer.

** DB2 Advanced Copy Services help protect mission-critical data that requires
** 24x7 availability. It offers an integrated solution designed to implement
** high-efficiency backup and restore processes and helps eliminate
** backup-related performance issues.

<% @components.each do |comp| -%>
COMP                     = <%= comp %>
<% end -%>

<% @languages.each do |lang| -%>
LANG                     = <%= lang %>
<% end -%>


** (Valid for non-root upgrade only) Upgrade Older Release
** -------------------------------------------------------
** Specify whether you want to upgrade any previous versions of the product. 
** Specifying this keyword will remove any previous version and upgrade any
** settings to the new installation.  Be aware that during upgrade of the
** current copy, only the product specified in the response file will be
** installed. Other previously installed products need to be upgraded
** separately following this upgrade.
*UPGRADE_PRIOR_VERSIONS   = FALSE           ** TRUE or FALSE
